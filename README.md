# downbeat
So downbeat is a simple 2d platformer.
There is a metronome ticking and whenever it hits the downbeat the gravity changes directions.
The time signature and tempo might change with different levels.

 Also, make slippery and sticky surfaces in different levels. And jumpy surfaces.

 Maybe make a dash abillity
	It might have to be on the beat in some way
Pickups that give jumps and dashes
