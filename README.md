# downbeat
So downbeat is a simple 2d platformer.
There is a metronome ticking and whenever it hits the downbeat the gravity changes directions.
The time signature and tempo might change with different levels.

NOTE: Josiah is a poopypants. Also, make slippery and sticky surfaces in different levels. And jumpy surfaces.
